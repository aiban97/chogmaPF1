      <span class="para">
        The Church of God Meghalaya & Assam has an indigenous origin. This
        &lsquo;indigenous&rsquo; indicates that the Church of God in Meghalaya
        and Assam was started by the native persons and not by the foreign
        persons or by foreign missionaries. This shows that from the very
        beginning the Church of God has a local leadership. This name
        &lsquo;Church of God&rsquo; is found written or recorded in the Bible
        many times. These pioneers adopted this name because they felt more
        suitable to use it. It is a fact which Jesus himself said “On this rock
        I will build my Church” (Mt.16:18). This indicates that Jesus is the
        Lord of the Church. Apostle Paul in many occasions tried to explain that
        this Church which has started and built by Jesus who is the Son of God
        must be the Church of God. For example, Paul said “The Church of God
        which is at Corinth” (I Corinth 1:2). Like Paul Luke also recorded about
        the Church of God. He said “The Church of God which He purchased with
        His own Blood”(Acts 20:28). Luke gives a clear indication that the
        Church of God has been purchased or redeemed by the precious blood of
        Jesus Christ.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        It is an undeniable fact that the pioneers of the Church of God in
        Meghalaya and Assam were identified as Rev. J.J.M. Nichols-Roy Syiemlieh
        and Rev. Wolley Mohan Roy Laitphlang. The so-called the Church of God
        was officially formed in 1902. It was Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy Laitphlang
        and Mr. Joy Mohan Roy (Later on known as Rev. J.J.M. Nichols-Roy) and
        Mr. Jobin Roy Khain and Mr. E. Dhorum were also the founding members of
        the Church of God.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        Though the Church of God was established by Khasi leaders yet the ideas
        that were to lead to its establishment may also come from other people
        by way of giving some suggestions how to abide to the Biblical
        principles. For instance, the leaders of the Salvation Army speak that
        salvation is possible to have and experience in this world of here and
        now. The leaders the Baptist Church seems to have suggested that real
        and Biblical Baptism is the immersion Baptism as it was baptized in the
        river Jordan.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        A reading of the history of the Church of God is thus becoming
        important. However, given the significance of an ecumenical perception
        in today's thinking, it is more important to look at it in the light of
        an over all Christian role among the hill people in the 19th and 20th
        centuries and from a historical perspective. Given that, this essay will
        deal with the historical background, influence of the British
        government, Christian Missions and Churches; Pioneers of the Church of
        God and impact on the hill people.

      <span class="pioneer_bg">Background of Wolley Mohan Roy</span>
      <span class="pioneer-para"
        >For a number of years the Church of God is known as the Church of God
        movement all over in Khasi and Jaintia Hills of Meghalaya. The reason
        was because this new Church of God which was started by Mr. Wolloy Mohan
        Roy Laitphlang, was a holiness movement. Holiness movement indicates a
        moral movement to propagate about holy life. People must be free from
        sin. The bondage in sin leads to death but they can be relieved only by
        faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. He was born and brought up in a
        godly Christian family of the Presbyterian Church of Sohra. It may be
        mentioned that Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy was a mission school teacher and a
        Sunday school teacher in the Presbyterian Church at Mawkhar Presbyterian
        Church in Shillong. He was greatly moved and influenced by the teaching
        of the Salvation Army on the concept and implication of Holiness in
        Christian life. One day he met a friend from the Army and he asked him a
        very important question “Arc you saved?” This question moved his soul to
        rethink of his faith in Jesus Christ. Since that time Mr. Wolley Mohan
        Roy tried to re-read the Bible and re-examining the truths of the
        Scriptures both in Khasi and English languages. He realized that it is
        true that a person who truly believes in Jesus Christ can be set free
        from sins and he can become a liberated person.
      </span>
      <span class="pioneer-para">
        Interestingly Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy appreciated the Baptist tradition
        especially the immersion Baptism. He learnt many good things from his
        close friend u Donrai Diengdoh. Gradually Wolley Mohan Roy questioned
        the Church Elders regarding the teachings of the Presbyterian during his
        time. In this way a sense of differences began between the Presbyterian
        Church and Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy on the issues of holiness. Within no
        time a conflict of interest developed from bad to worst. Ultimately,
        Wolley Mohan Roy openly showed his sense of grief and dissatisfaction.
        Mr. Wolloy Mohan Roy was eventually terminated from the Presbyterian
        Church.

      <span class="pioneer-para"
        >Joy Mohan Roy (Later on known as Rev. J. J. M. Nichols-Roy) became a
        Christian after his experiences of the devastating earthquake taken in
        Khasi Hills in 1897. Many people died during that time specially the
        people of Shella Village. Joy Mohan Roy was very thankful to God for
        sparing his life during the terrible earthquake taken place in his
        village. While Joy Mohan was in West Bengal for his studies he had some
        contacts with the Christian leaders of the Baptist Church in the West.
        Initially he went to Calcutta in 1899 mainly for his graduate studies at
        Duff College. Later on it was nomenclatured as Scottish Church College.
        It happened that in the month of December 1900 he attended a Students’
        Conference held at Serampore and he courageously made a public
        commitment before God. He dedicated his life to the service of God. Joy
        Mohan Roy also realized the importance to live a life of holiness. This
        should begin with a repented way of life. Joy learnt about holiness is a
        life to fully devote in the faith in Jesus Christ. It seems that Joy
        Mohan Roy was influenced by the Anderson Church of God in United States
        of America. He met Sister Nora Evalyne Nichols in West Bengal (Later on
        she was the wife of J. J. M. Nichols-Roy).

    <div class="about-heading-bar">Wolley Mohan Roy and Joy Mohan Roy</div>
    <div class="msg-con">
      <span class="para">
        One day Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy and Joy Mohan Roy met together in Shillong.
        They shared their theological experiences. Surprisingly they found that
        they have similar theological experiences. In reality they did not know
        each other. It was Bah Dino Dkhar (the younger brother of Mr. Sib Charan
        Roy) who at first introduced Mr. Joy Mohan Roy to Mr. Wolley Mohan Roy
        in Shillong in the year 1901. Since that time, they became great
        friends. Both of them committed themselves to preach and proclaim the
        Gospel of Jesus Christ. Within no time other members like Mr. Jobin Roy
        Khain and Mr. E. Dhorom joined the group of Wolley Mohan Roy and Joy
        Mohan Roy.

    <div class="about-heading-bar">Four members were baptized</div>
    <div class="msg-con">
      <span class="para">
        The Church of God began in actuality in 1902 in which four members were
        baptized at Mylliem Nongbet in 1902. In this way the new Church known as
        the Church of God which is known in the local Khasi language as ‘Ka
        Balang U Blei’ was officially formed. This indicates that the Church of
        God was under the local leadership which may be called an indigenous
        Church. The theological teachings were based on the Bible as the
        authentic word of God. Here it may be mentioned that the main
        theological teachings of the Church of God are Repentance, Holiness,
        Immersion Baptism and Foot washing.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        The leaders of the Church of God emphasized a new life style of
        holiness. It rejects child baptism because children should be dedicated
        to God and not Baptism. For instance, immersion baptism is not possible
        for the children. The leaders of the Church of God rejected the
        statement made by other Churches. For example, “I am a sinner. He is a
        sinner. You are a sinner. They are sinners” The leaders of the Church of
        God agreed in principle that human beings are sinful. But they believed
        that the power of our sinful nature could be overcome by the grace of
        God in Jesus Christ the Savior. They believe that it is through faith in
        Jesus that brings to us a regenerated life. It is for this reason
        repentance should be followed by Immersion baptism.

    <div class="about-heading-bar">The family of Nichols-Roy</div>
    <div class="msg-con">
      <span class="para">
        Again, it may be mentioned the new Church formed by Mr. Joy Mohan Roy
        and Wolley Mohan Roy faced so much of financial problems at the initial
        stage. For instance, Joy Mohan Roy left Khasi hills to continue his
        studies in Calcutta. He left behind a small group of church members and
        evangelists without any financial support. In fact, those who formed the
        Church of God had to resign their jobs with a view to work for the
        Gospel of Jesus Christ. The leaders were without an income. While he was
        in Calcutta (Kolkata) Mr. Joy Mohan Roy met some Christian friends. In
        the process of sharing of faith they came to know that they have a
        similar faith experience in Jesus Christ. One of them was John A. D.
        Khan, a Muslim convert, who had already established contacts with the
        Church of God in Anderson, U.S.A, in 1903. It happened that some
        American friends invited John A.D. Khan to visit the Church of God in
        U.S.A. Consequently, Khan visited the Church of God in U.S.A. and
        returned to Calcutta in 1904 with a group of Anderson Church of God
        members. Amazingly, one among young American lady who visited India was
        Miss Nora Evalyn Nichols who later became the wife of Joy Mohan Roy. At
        that time Joy Mohan Roy completed his Bachelor of Arts Degree in
        Philosophy from the Calcutta University.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        It may be noted that soon the missionaries who came from America left
        for their homes except for Miss Nora Evalyne Nichols who preferred to
        stay back in the Khasi Hills in order to fulfill her commitment to work
        among the Khasi women. It may be noteworthy to mention that in 1907 she
        married Mr. Joy Mohan Roy. They adopted a family name known as
        “Nichols-Roy”.

    <div class="about-heading-bar">The Growth of The Church</div>
    <div class="msg-con">
      <span class="para">
        It may be mentioned that the growth of the Church was quite steady.
        Today it has many local churches established in more than 700 villages
        over the Khasi Hills, Jaintia Hills and Garo Hills. Today we have a
        total of more than 2 lakhs membership. It may be mentioned that the
        ecclesiastical structure of the Church of God in Meghalaya and Assam was
        well structured and designed. It has local committees within local
        Churches. It also organized some circle levels, District levels and
        Assembly level. Regarding the Business management it has the Business
        Association. This is an administrative body formed by the
        representatives of different levels
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        It was in the year 1978 the body that looks after the spiritual matter
        was formed. It is called the “Pastors’ Fellowship”. This body comprises
        all ordained ministers of the Church of God, Meghalaya and Assam. It is
        looking and supervising the spiritual works, like Ordination,
        appointment of the Church workers, transfer or reshuffle of the Church
        workers from one area to the other and all those areas which are falling
        under the spiritual matters of the Church. It created few integrated
        Ministries, like the Mission Board, Women Department, Youth Department,
        Sunday Schools, Nichols-Roy Bible College, Child Sponsorship Programme,
        Evangelism Department and other ecclesiastical ministries including the
        Media Ministry. The Church of God Business Association is exercising its
        power in the sense to look after the general administration like
        financial matters, Education, properties and other matters except the
        spiritual realm of the Church.

    <div class="about-heading-bar">Conclusion</div>
    <div class="msg-con">
      <span class="para">
        At the initial stage the Church of God in Meghalaya and Assam did not
        emphasize to have theological training. The Church of God Business
        Association was a sole deciding power in most of the Church affairs till
        1977. Till today the Church of God in Meghalaya and Assam did not give
        any emphasis to ordain any woman Church worker. In 1982 the Church of
        God changed its theological stand. It started a Bible School in 1982 at
        Qualapatty, Shillong. In 1992 it upgraded the Bible School into the
        College level. Since the year 1979 the young Church workers were
        encouraged to have theological training in Cherra Theological College,
        Sohra but some were sent to have B.Th and B.D. Degrees in Union Biblical
        Seminary, Pune.
      </span>
      <span class="para">
        In the year 2018 the Church of God Business Association opened a secular
        College known as <b>J.J.M. Nichols-Roy College</b>, at Qualapatty,
        Shillong. It may be also mentioned that the Church of God takes up some
        publication of religious books. For example this was started since the
        year 1905. The Church magazine entitled
        <b>“The Light of the Gospel”</b> is still continuing even today. An
        indigenous publication entitled
        <b>Ki Jingrwai Shem Mynsiem (The Experienced Spiritual Songs)</b> was
        started more than a hundred years. It may be mentioned that today there
        are more than
        <b
          >100 Primary Schools, 3 Middle English Schools and 3 Secondary
          Schools, and 2 Higher secondary schools</b
        >. Perhaps, one of the most distinctive features of the Church works is
        the practice - of divine healing (This kind of healing is not a magic
        but a reality). Many people have been healed through prayers and
        fasting. The growth of the church has generally been attributed to its
        healing ministry. The members of the church are mostly the poor and the
        illiterate people in the rural areas. But till today the Church did not
        have any Medical Centre and medical services but this does not mean
        medical treatment be desisted or rejected.
